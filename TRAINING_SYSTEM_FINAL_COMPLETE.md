### ✅ Issue 5: "How to add quizzes - database setup?"
**ANSWER: CLARIFIED!**

**Two Ways to Add/Edit Training Content:**

**BEFORE Database Seeding (Now):**
1. Edit `app-training-modules.ts` file
2. Add/modify quiz questions in code
3. Run seed script to populate database
4. ✅ **This is what we've done** - ready to seed

**AFTER Database Seeding (Post-Launch - Better):**
1. Build admin panel in frontend
2. Managers add/edit quizzes through UI
3. No code changes needed
4. ✅ Recommended for ongoing management

**Database Setup Steps:**
```bash
# Step 1: Generate migration (creates table schemas)
npm run migration:generate -- -n CreateTrainingTables

# Step 2: Run migration (creates actual tables)
npm run migration:run

# Step 3: Seed training modules (populates with content)
npm run seed:training-modules

# Done! Training system ready to use ✅
```

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Entity definitions created (TypeORM classes)
- ✅ Training content defined (app-training-modules.ts)
- ✅ Seed script created (database/seeds/training-modules.seed.ts)
- ⏳ Need to run: migration + seed (5 minutes work)
