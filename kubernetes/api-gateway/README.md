## Configuration Details

### Kong Architecture

**3-Tier Architecture:**
- **Kong Proxy** - Handles all API traffic with load balancing
- **Kong Admin API** - Configuration and management interface
- **Kong Ingress Controller** - Kubernetes-native configuration management
- **PostgreSQL Database** - Stores Kong configuration and state

**High Availability Setup:**
- **3 Kong replicas** for load distribution and fault tolerance
- **PostgreSQL with persistent storage** for configuration persistence
- **Kubernetes ingress** for external traffic management
- **Health checks** and readiness probes for reliability

### Healthcare-Specific Plugins

#### Authentication and Authorization

**JWT Authentication Plugin:**
- **Healthcare-specific claims** (user_id, tenant_id, healthcare_role, care_home_id)
- **Token expiration** management (24 hours for general access, 1 hour for compliance)
- **Claims-to-headers** mapping for downstream services
- **Preflight request** handling for CORS

**ACL (Access Control List) Plugin:**
- **Role-based access control** for different healthcare user types
- **Service-specific permissions** (medication-administration, care-planning, audit-access)
- **Hierarchical access** (administrators > care-managers > healthcare-staff)

#### Rate Limiting

**Healthcare-Specific Rate Limits:**
- **Medication Service**: 500/minute, 5,000/hour (critical safety)
- **Resident Service**: 1,000/minute, 10,000/hour (high usage)
- **Compliance Service**: 200/minute, 2,000/hour (audit access)
- **NHS Integration**: 100/minute, 1,000/hour (external API limits)
- **Family Portal**: 500/minute, 5,000/hour (family access)

**Redis-Based Rate Limiting:**
- **Distributed rate limiting** across Kong instances
- **Fault-tolerant** operation with fallback to local limits
- **Per-consumer** and per-service rate limiting
- **Custom rate limits** for different healthcare operations

#### Security and Compliance

**CORS Plugin:**
- **Healthcare application origins** (app.writecarenotes.com, admin.writecarenotes.com)
- **Secure headers** (Authorization, X-Tenant-ID, X-Healthcare-Context)
- **Credentials support** for authenticated requests
- **Preflight caching** for performance

**Request/Response Transformation:**
- **Security headers** (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, CSP)
- **Healthcare context** headers (X-Healthcare-System, X-Compliance-Framework)
- **Request ID** and correlation ID injection
- **Sensitive header** removal (X-Internal-Token, X-Debug-Info)

**IP Restriction Plugin:**
- **Administrative endpoint** protection (internal networks only)
- **Compliance access** restrictions for audit security
- **Configurable allow/deny** lists for different environments

#### Logging and Monitoring

**HTTP Log Plugin:**
- **Structured logging** to Logstash with healthcare context
- **Custom fields** (healthcare_context, compliance_level, audit_required)
- **Healthcare identifiers** (resident_id, medication_id, nhs_number)
- **Request/response** correlation for audit trails

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Kong Metrics

**Built-in Metrics:**
- Request count and response times
- Error rates by service and consumer
- Rate limiting statistics
- Plugin execution metrics

**Healthcare-Specific Metrics:**
- Medication administration API calls
- Compliance access patterns
- NHS integration usage
- Family portal engagement

### Common Issues

**Kong not starting:**
```bash
# Check Kong pods
kubectl get pods -n api-gateway -l app=kong
kubectl logs -n api-gateway <kong-pod-name>

# Check PostgreSQL connection
kubectl exec -n api-gateway <kong-pod> -- kong health
```

**Authentication failures:**
```bash
# Check JWT configuration
kubectl get secrets -n api-gateway
kubectl describe kongconsumer healthcare-staff -n api-gateway

# Verify JWT token
echo "<jwt-token>" | base64 -d
```

**Rate limiting issues:**
```bash
# Check Redis connection
kubectl exec -n api-gateway <kong-pod> -- redis-cli -h redis-cluster ping

# Check rate limiting plugin
kubectl get kongplugins -n api-gateway healthcare-rate-limiting -o yaml
```

**Service routing problems:**
```bash
# Check ingress configuration
kubectl get ingress -n api-gateway writecarenotes-api-ingress -o yaml

# Test service connectivity
kubectl exec -n api-gateway <kong-pod> -- curl http://resident-service.core-healthcare:3001/health
```

### Performance Tuning

**Kong Configuration:**
- **Worker processes**: Auto-scaled based on CPU cores
- **Worker connections**: 1024 per worker
- **Database connections**: Pooled for performance
- **Plugin execution**: Optimized for healthcare workflows

**Rate Limiting Optimization:**
- **Redis clustering** for distributed rate limiting
- **Local fallback** for Redis unavailability
- **Sliding window** algorithms for accurate limiting
- **Consumer-specific** limits for different user types

## Security Considerations

### Healthcare Data Protection

**Encryption:**
- **TLS 1.3** for all API traffic
- **JWT token encryption** with healthcare-specific claims
- **Database encryption** for Kong configuration
- **Header sanitization** to remove sensitive information

**Access Control:**
- **Role-based permissions** aligned with healthcare roles
- **Service-level authorization** for fine-grained access
- **IP restrictions** for administrative functions
- **Audit logging** for all API access

### Compliance Features

**GDPR Compliance:**
- **Data subject identification** in request headers
- **Consent tracking** through API calls
- **Data retention** policies in logging
- **Right to be forgotten** support in audit trails

**Healthcare Regulatory Compliance:**
- **NHS Digital standards** compliance for integration
- **CQC/Care Inspectorate** audit trail requirements
- **Medication safety** logging and monitoring
- **Clinical data protection** through access controls
