# Microservices Architecture Transition Requirements

## Introduction

WriteCareNotes is a comprehensive British Isles Adult Care Home Management System that has grown into a monolithic application with extensive functionality. To support enterprise-scale operations, regulatory compliance, and future growth, we need to transition to a microservices architecture that can handle:

- 1000+ concurrent users across multiple care homes
- Real-time healthcare data processing
- Regulatory compliance across 4 jurisdictions (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland)
- Integration with NHS systems, CQC, and other healthcare authorities
- Financial processing and payroll management
- AI-powered predictive analytics and automation

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Healthcare Services Decomposition

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to decompose the monolithic application into domain-specific microservices, so that each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is decomposed THEN it SHALL have separate microservices for each major healthcare domain
2. WHEN a microservice is deployed THEN it SHALL be independently deployable without affecting other services
3. WHEN a microservice fails THEN other services SHALL continue to operate normally
4. WHEN scaling is required THEN individual services SHALL be scalable based on demand
5. WHEN regulatory compliance is audited THEN each service SHALL maintain its own compliance boundaries

### Requirement 2: Service Communication and Integration

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want seamless integration between different care management functions, so that I can access comprehensive resident information without system boundaries affecting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services communicate THEN they SHALL use event-driven architecture with message queues
2. WHEN data is shared between services THEN it SHALL use well-defined APIs with versioning
3. WHEN real-time updates occur THEN they SHALL be propagated across relevant services immediately
4. WHEN external systems integrate THEN they SHALL use standardized healthcare APIs (FHIR R4)
5. WHEN service dependencies exist THEN they SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns for resilience

### Requirement 3: Data Management and Consistency

**User Story:** As a care home administrator, I want consistent and accurate data across all care management functions, so that regulatory reporting and resident care decisions are based on reliable information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is updated in one service THEN related data in other services SHALL be eventually consistent
2. WHEN critical healthcare data is modified THEN it SHALL maintain ACID properties within service boundaries
3. WHEN cross-service transactions are required THEN they SHALL use saga patterns for distributed transactions
4. WHEN data privacy is required THEN each service SHALL implement field-level encryption for PII
5. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN each service SHALL maintain comprehensive audit logs

### Requirement 4: Security and Compliance Architecture

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want each microservice to maintain healthcare regulatory compliance independently, so that audit boundaries are clear and compliance violations are contained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services authenticate users THEN they SHALL use centralized identity management with JWT tokens
2. WHEN authorization is required THEN each service SHALL implement role-based access control (RBAC)
3. WHEN sensitive data is processed THEN it SHALL be encrypted in transit and at rest
4. WHEN audit events occur THEN they SHALL be centrally logged with correlation IDs
5. WHEN compliance violations are detected THEN they SHALL be isolated to specific service boundaries

### Requirement 5: Deployment and DevOps Architecture

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want each microservice to be containerized and orchestrated, so that deployment, scaling, and monitoring can be automated and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are deployed THEN they SHALL be containerized using Docker
2. WHEN orchestration is required THEN services SHALL be managed by Kubernetes
3. WHEN monitoring is needed THEN each service SHALL expose health checks and metrics
4. WHEN CI/CD pipelines run THEN each service SHALL be independently testable and deployable
5. WHEN service discovery is required THEN it SHALL use Kubernetes service discovery mechanisms

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability Architecture

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the microservices architecture to handle enterprise-scale load efficiently, so that care home operations are never interrupted by system performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN load increases THEN services SHALL auto-scale based on CPU, memory, and custom metrics
2. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL complete within 100ms for 95th percentile
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL respond within 200ms for standard operations
4. WHEN caching is implemented THEN it SHALL use Redis for distributed caching
5. WHEN load balancing is required THEN it SHALL distribute traffic evenly across service instances

### Requirement 7: Observability and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability across all microservices, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues before they impact care operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services operate THEN they SHALL emit structured logs with correlation IDs
2. WHEN metrics are collected THEN they SHALL include business metrics and technical metrics
3. WHEN distributed tracing is required THEN it SHALL track requests across service boundaries
4. WHEN alerts are triggered THEN they SHALL be based on SLA violations and business impact
5. WHEN dashboards are viewed THEN they SHALL show service health, performance, and business KPIs

### Requirement 8: Healthcare Integration Standards

**User Story:** As a healthcare integration specialist, I want the microservices to support standard healthcare protocols and formats, so that integration with NHS systems and other healthcare providers is seamless.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN healthcare data is exchanged THEN it SHALL use FHIR R4 standards
2. WHEN NHS integration is required THEN it SHALL support NHS Digital APIs
3. WHEN clinical terminology is used THEN it SHALL support SNOMED CT coding
4. WHEN medication data is processed THEN it SHALL use dm+d (Dictionary of medicines and devices)
5. WHEN patient identification is required THEN it SHALL validate NHS numbers using check digit algorithms

### Requirement 9: Multi-Tenancy and Organization Management

**User Story:** As a multi-care-home operator, I want the microservices architecture to support multiple organizations with data isolation, so that each care home's data remains secure and separate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple organizations use the system THEN data SHALL be isolated at the service level
2. WHEN tenant identification is required THEN it SHALL be included in all service communications
3. WHEN configuration is needed THEN each tenant SHALL have independent configuration management
4. WHEN billing is calculated THEN it SHALL be tracked per tenant and service usage
5. WHEN compliance reporting is generated THEN it SHALL be scoped to specific tenants

### Requirement 10: Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

**User Story:** As a business continuity manager, I want the microservices architecture to support comprehensive disaster recovery, so that care operations can continue even during major system failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN disaster recovery is activated THEN services SHALL failover to secondary regions within 15 minutes
2. WHEN data backup is required THEN each service SHALL maintain point-in-time recovery capabilities
3. WHEN service restoration is needed THEN it SHALL follow documented recovery procedures
4. WHEN business continuity testing occurs THEN it SHALL validate cross-service recovery scenarios
5. WHEN regulatory notifications are required THEN they SHALL be automatically generated during incidents
