- **Financial Accuracy**: Incorrect financial calculations could cause business issues

### Mitigation Strategies
- Prioritize patient safety features in Phase 1
- Implement comprehensive testing before any production use
- Conduct regular security audits throughout development
- Maintain detailed audit trails for all changes
- Implement gradual rollout with extensive monitoring

### Timeline Estimates
- **Phase 1 (Critical Foundation)**: 3 months with full team
- **Phase 2 (Core Functionality)**: 3 months with full team
- **Phase 3 (Advanced Features)**: 6 months with full team
- **Phase 4 (Production Readiness)**: 3+ months with full team

### Total Estimated Effort
- **Minimum**: 15 months with experienced healthcare development team
- **Realistic**: 18-24 months including testing, compliance, and deployment
- **Conservative**: 24-30 months including full security and compliance certification

This implementation plan transforms the current 5% complete system into a truly production-ready healthcare management platform that meets all regulatory requirements and industry standards.
