# Design Document

## Overview

The British Isles Adult Care Home Management System is designed as a comprehensive, cloud-based platform that provides end-to-end care home management capabilities. The system follows a microservices architecture with a modern web-based frontend, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and compliance with healthcare data protection regulations including GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018, and regional healthcare standards.

The platform integrates with existing healthcare systems (NHS Digital, HSC Northern Ireland, NHS Wales, NHS Scotland) and regulatory bodies while providing offline capabilities for critical operations during connectivity issues.
