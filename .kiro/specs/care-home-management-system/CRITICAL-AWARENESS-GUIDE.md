# WriteCareNotes Critical Awareness Guide

## üö® **What We Must Be Aware Of - Healthcare System Risks**

Building a healthcare system involves unique challenges and risks that could have serious consequences. Here's what we absolutely must be aware of and plan for.

## üè• **1. CLINICAL SAFETY RISKS**

### **Patient Safety is Everything**
```typescript
// ‚ùå DANGEROUS - Could harm patients
function calculateMedicationDose(weight: number, age: number): number {
  return weight * 0.5; // Oversimplified - could be lethal
}

// ‚úÖ SAFE - Comprehensive safety checks
function calculateMedicationDose(
  medication: Medication,
  patient: Patient,
  prescriber: Prescriber
): SafeDosageResult {
  // Multiple safety validations
  const allergies = checkAllergies(medication, patient);
  const interactions = checkDrugInteractions(medication, patient.currentMeds);
  const contraindications = checkContraindications(medication, patient);
  const ageAppropriate = checkAgeAppropriate(medication, patient.age);
  const weightAppropriate = checkWeightDosing(medication, patient.weight);
  
  if (allergies.hasAllergies || interactions.hasCritical || contraindications.hasAny) {
    return { safe: false, reasons: [...] };
  }
  
  return calculateSafeDosage(medication, patient, prescriber);
}
```

### **Clinical Risk Areas to Monitor:**
- **Medication Errors**: Wrong drug, wrong dose, wrong patient, wrong time
- **Risk Assessment Accuracy**: Incorrect risk levels leading to inadequate care
- **Care Plan Failures**: Missing critical care requirements
- **Emergency Response**: System failures during medical emergencies
- **Data Integrity**: Corrupted medical data affecting clinical decisions
- **Alert Fatigue**: Too many false alerts causing staff to ignore real ones

## üîí **2. DATA PROTECTION & PRIVACY RISKS**

### **Healthcare Data is Ultra-Sensitive**
```typescript
// Healthcare data classification
enum DataSensitivity {
  PUBLIC = 'public',           // Care home address
  INTERNAL = 'internal',       // Staff schedules
  CONFIDENTIAL = 'confidential', // Resident names, basic info
  RESTRICTED = 'restricted',   // Medical conditions, medications
  TOP_SECRET = 'top_secret'    // Mental health, safeguarding
}

// Every data access must be justified and logged
interface DataAccess {
  userId: StaffId;
  dataType: DataSensitivity;
  resourceId: string;
  clinicalJustification: string;
  lawfulBasis: GDPRLawfulBasis;
  timestamp: Date;
  auditTrail: boolean;
}
```

### **Privacy Risk Areas:**
- **Data Breaches**: Unauthorized access to resident medical records
- **GDPR Violations**: Improper data processing, missing consent
- **Audit Trail Gaps**: Missing logs for data access and changes
