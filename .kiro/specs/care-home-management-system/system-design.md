# WriteCareNotes System Design Document

## System Overview

WriteCareNotes is designed as a cloud-native, microservices-based enterprise platform that provides comprehensive care home management capabilities. The system architecture prioritizes scalability, security, compliance, and performance while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to changing healthcare regulations and business requirements.

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
The system is organized around business domains with clear bounded contexts:
- **Care Domain**: Resident management, care planning, assessments
- **Operations Domain**: Bed management, scheduling, staff management
- **Financial Domain**: Accounting, billing, financial analytics, tax optimization
- **HR Domain**: Employee management, payroll, performance management
- **Compliance Domain**: Regulatory reporting, audit management, quality assurance

### 2. Microservices Architecture
Each business capability is implemented as an independent microservice:
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Technology diversity where appropriate
- Fault isolation and resilience
- Team autonomy and ownership

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
Services communicate through domain events:
- Loose coupling between services
- Eventual consistency where appropriate
- Audit trail through event sourcing
- Real-time notifications and updates

### 4. API-First Design
All functionality exposed through well-defined APIs:
- RESTful APIs for CRUD operations
- GraphQL for complex queries and real-time subscriptions
- OpenAPI 3.0 documentation for all endpoints
- Versioning strategy for backward compatibility
