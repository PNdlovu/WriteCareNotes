3. WHEN maintenance is required THEN the system SHALL perform updates with zero downtime using blue-green deployment strategies
4. IF primary data centers fail THEN the system SHALL seamlessly switch to backup facilities without user awareness
5. WHEN recovery procedures are needed THEN the system SHALL execute automated disaster recovery with real-time status reporting

### Requirement 6: Regulatory Compliance & Audit Trail

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want immutable audit trails that exceed regulatory requirements, so that we can demonstrate compliance to CQC, Care Inspectorate, CIW, and RQIA.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system action occurs THEN the system SHALL create tamper-proof audit records with cryptographic verification
2. WHEN audit data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide complete trails with legal-grade evidence integrity
3. WHEN compliance reports are generated THEN the system SHALL automatically verify all regulatory requirements are met
4. IF audit tampering is attempted THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent modifications while alerting authorities
5. WHEN regulatory inspections occur THEN the system SHALL provide real-time access to all required documentation and evidence

### Requirement 7: Advanced Access Control & Identity Management

**User Story:** As a system security administrator, I want granular access control that prevents privilege escalation, so that users can only access what they absolutely need for their role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the system THEN they SHALL authenticate using multi-factor authentication with biometric verification
2. WHEN permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL implement just-in-time access with automatic expiration
3. WHEN role changes occur THEN the system SHALL require approval workflows with multiple authorization levels
4. IF privilege escalation is attempted THEN the system SHALL immediately block access and trigger security investigations
5. WHEN access patterns are analyzed THEN the system SHALL use behavioral analytics to detect compromised accounts

### Requirement 8: Real-Time System Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want comprehensive system health monitoring that predicts issues before they occur, so that we maintain 99.99% uptime for critical healthcare operations.
