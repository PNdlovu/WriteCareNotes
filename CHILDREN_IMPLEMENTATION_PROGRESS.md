## 💡 DESIGN DECISIONS

### Why Separate Domain Folders?
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Easier to navigate large codebase
- ✅ Better code organization
- ✅ Follows Domain-Driven Design principles
- ✅ Matches existing pattern in codebase

### Why Not Extend Resident Entity?
- ✅ Children have fundamentally different requirements
- ✅ OFSTED vs CQC compliance
- ✅ Different legal frameworks
- ✅ Separate data protection considerations
- ✅ Cleaner schema and queries

### JSON Fields vs Separate Tables?
- ✅ JSON for flexible, rarely-queried data (allergies, immunizations)
- ✅ Separate tables for frequently-queried data (placements, safeguarding)
- ✅ Balance between flexibility and performance
