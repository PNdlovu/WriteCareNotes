# WriteCareNotes - Domain Implementation Roadmap

## Current Status: 2,625 TypeScript Errors (40% reduction from 4,436)

### ‚úÖ Completed Foundational Work
- [x] Separated frontend/backend TypeScript compilation (1,576 errors fixed)
- [x] Fixed duplicate identifiers (82 errors fixed)
- [x] Created authentication guards and decorators (132 errors fixed)
- [x] Removed unsafe stub files that created false security

## üéØ Domain Priority Implementation Strategy

### Priority 1: CORE DOMAIN - Care Management ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Impact**: Foundation for all other features
**Current Errors**: 58 module errors in domain
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

#### Required Implementations:
1. **Core Entities** (CRITICAL - Referenced by 58+ files):
   - [ ] `Resident` entity - src/domains/care/entities/Resident.ts
   - [ ] `CareNote` entity - src/domains/care/entities/CareNote.ts
   - [ ] `CareAssessment` entity
   - [ ] `CareEvent` entity

2. **Core Services**:
   - [x] ResidentService (exists: src/services/resident/ResidentService.fixed.ts)
   - [ ] CareNoteService
   - [ ] CareAssessmentService

3. **Dependencies**:
   - Requires: StaffMember entity (referenced 32 times)
   - Requires: Organization/Tenant entities (exist)

#### Why First:
- Most frequently referenced domain (58 errors)
- Required by: AI, Engagement, Finance, Compliance domains
- Core business logic - can't operate without residents

---

### Priority 2: STAFF DOMAIN ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Impact**: Required by Care, unlocks scheduling & compliance
**Current Errors**: 32 module errors
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks

#### Required Implementations:
1. **Core Entities**:
   - [ ] `StaffMember` entity - src/domains/staff/entities/StaffMember.ts
   - [ ] `StaffSchedule` entity
   - [ ] `EmployeeProfile` entity (exists but incomplete)

2. **Core Services**:
   - [x] StaffRevolutionService (exists)
   - [ ] StaffSchedulingService
   - [ ] HRManagementService (exists but needs fixes)

#### Why Second:
- Required by Care domain (staff assigned to residents)
- 32 direct references
- Blocks compliance and audit features

---

### Priority 3: ENGAGEMENT DOMAIN ‚≠ê
**Impact**: Differentiator feature, relatively isolated
**Current Errors**: 6 module errors (LOWEST!)
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days

#### Required Implementations:
1. **Core Entities**:
   - [x] `Activity` entity (exists: src/domains/engagement/entities/Activity.ts)
   - [x] `AttendanceRecord` entity (exists)

2. **Core Services**:
   - [x] EngagementService (exists: src/domains/engagement/services/EngagementService.ts)

3. **Dependencies**:
   - Requires: Resident entity (Priority 1)
   - Requires: StaffMember entity (Priority 2)

#### Why Third:
- LEAST errors (only 6!)
- Most entities/services already exist
- Quick win after Care/Staff
- Good for morale and demo purposes

---

### Priority 4: FINANCE DOMAIN ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Impact**: Revenue-critical, complex
**Current Errors**: 59 module errors (HIGHEST!)
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks

#### Required Implementations:
1. **Core Entities** (Many exist in src/entities/financial/):
   - [x] Invoice (exists)
   - [x] Payment (exists)
   - [x] Budget (exists)
   - [ ] Complete integration with domain structure

2. **Core Services**:
   - [x] FinancialReimbursementService (exists)
   - [ ] BudgetService (referenced but incomplete)
   - [ ] FinancialAnalyticsService (referenced but missing)

#### Why Fourth:
- Most complex domain (59 errors)
- Requires: Resident, Staff entities
- Critical but can operate with manual processes initially

---

### Priority 5: COMPLIANCE DOMAIN ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Impact**: Regulatory requirement
**Current Errors**: 38 module errors
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

#### Required Implementations:
1. **Core Services**:
   - [x] CQCDigitalStandardsService (exists)
   - [x] CareInspectorateScotlandService (exists)
   - [x] CIWWalesComplianceService (exists)
   - [ ] Complete method implementations (missing getComplianceAssessment, etc.)

#### Why Fifth:
- Requires: Care, Staff domains to be complete
- Critical for UK care homes but can use manual processes initially
- Complex regulatory logic

---

### Priority 6: AI DOMAIN ü§ñ
**Impact**: Differentiator, nice-to-have
**Current Errors**: 44 module errors
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 weeks

#### Required Implementations:
1. **Core Entities**:
   - [ ] AIAgentSession
   - [ ] AIAgentConversation
   - [ ] EventStream

2. **Core Services**:
   - [x] PublicCustomerSupportAIService (exists)
   - [x] TenantCareAssistantAIService (exists)
   - [ ] AIAgentLifecycleService
   - [ ] EventStreamService

#### Why Last (for now):
- Requires all other domains
- Differentiator but not blocker
- Can be MVP'd with simpler implementations

---

### Priority 7: INTEGRATION DOMAIN üîå
**Impact**: External systems
**Current Errors**: 46 module errors
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

#### Required Implementations:
1. **Core Services**:
   - [ ] GP Connect integration
   - [ ] NHS integration
   - [ ] External API connectors

#### Why Later:
- Requires stable core domains
- External dependencies
- Can mock initially

   - List all missing entities
   - List all missing services
   - Identify dependencies
   - Create task breakdown

2. **Entity Implementation** (2-3 days):
   - Create TypeORM entities with proper decorators
   - Add relationships
   - Add business logic methods
   - Write tests

3. **Service Implementation** (3-5 days):
   - Implement service methods
   - Add dependency injection
   - Handle error cases
   - Write tests

4. **Controller Updates** (1-2 days):
   - Fix import paths
   - Update method signatures
   - Add proper validation
   - Test endpoints

5. **Integration Testing** (1-2 days):
   - Test domain in isolation
   - Test cross-domain interactions
   - Fix integration issues

6. **Deployment** (1 day):

## üö® Non-Negotiables (Apply to ALL domains)

### Code Quality Standards:
- ‚úÖ **NO stub files** - Only implement what actually works
- ‚úÖ **Proper error handling** - All services throw meaningful errors
- ‚úÖ **TypeScript strict mode** - Fix type errors, don't bypass
- ‚úÖ **NestJS DI** - Use dependency injection, not `new Service()`
- ‚úÖ **Database migrations** - Never hand-edit production database
- ‚úÖ **Security** - All endpoints require authentication
- ‚úÖ **Audit trails** - Log all data modifications
- ‚úÖ **GDPR compliance** - Handle PII properly

### Testing Requirements:
- ‚úÖ Unit tests for business logic
- ‚úÖ Integration tests for services
- ‚úÖ E2E tests for critical paths
- ‚úÖ Minimum 70% code coverage

### Documentation Requirements:
- ‚úÖ API documentation (Swagger)
- ‚úÖ Service documentation (JSDoc)
- ‚úÖ Database schema documentation
- ‚úÖ Deployment guides
