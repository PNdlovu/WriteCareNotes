# üè† WriteCareNotes Care Home Terminology Standardization Plan

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Status:** üö® **CRITICAL ACCURACY IMPROVEMENT**  
**Priority:** **IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED**

## üìã **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

WriteCareNotes has **inconsistent terminology** throughout the codebase that needs immediate correction. The system is specifically designed for **adult care homes**, not general healthcare facilities, but many references incorrectly use "healthcare" terminology instead of the more accurate "care home" terminology.

This standardization is **critical for**:
- ‚úÖ **Regulatory Accuracy** - CQC specifically regulates care homes, not hospitals
- ‚úÖ **Market Clarity** - Care home managers need clear, relevant terminology
- ‚úÖ **Professional Credibility** - Industry-specific language builds trust
- ‚úÖ **Compliance Precision** - Care home regulations differ from hospital regulations

## üéØ **SCOPE OF CHANGES**

### **Current Problem:**
**‚ùå INCORRECT:** "healthcare management system"  
**‚úÖ CORRECT:** "care home management system"

**‚ùå INCORRECT:** "healthcare environments"  
**‚úÖ CORRECT:** "care home environments"

**‚ùå INCORRECT:** "healthcare workforce"  
**‚úÖ CORRECT:** "care home staff" or "care workforce"

**‚ùå INCORRECT:** "healthcare organization oversight"  
**‚úÖ CORRECT:** "care home organization oversight"

- ‚úÖ **Clinical standards** (DCB0129, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Medication management** clinical aspects
- ‚úÖ **GP Connect** and medical system integrations

### **BE CAREFUL With:**
- üîç **Staff roles** - Some may be healthcare professionals working in care homes
- üîç **Compliance references** - Ensure they point to care home specific regulations
- üîç **API endpoints** - May need updates if they include "healthcare" in URLs
- üîç **Database table/column names** - Avoid breaking changes

### **Compliance Mapping:**
| **Current** | **Correct Care Home Regulator** |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Healthcare regulators | CQC (England), Care Inspectorate Scotland, CIW Wales, RQIA Northern Ireland |
| Healthcare standards | Adult Social Care Standards |
| Healthcare compliance | Care Home Regulations |

1. **Start with Current File** (`031_create_jurisdiction_compliance_tables.ts`)
   - Fix the header comment to use "care home" terminology
   - Update compliance references

2. **Systematic File-by-File Updates**
   - Use multi-file replacement tools for efficiency
   - Test after each major group of changes

3. **Validation Steps**
   - Ensure build still works

   - Check that medical contexts retain healthcare terminology

### **Quality Assurance:**

1. **Terminology Consistency Check**
   - Scan for remaining "healthcare" instances
   - Verify each is contextually appropriate

2. **Regulatory Accuracy Validation**
   - Ensure all compliance references point to care home regulations
   - Verify CQC standards are properly referenced

3. **Professional Review**
   - System should clearly serve care home industry
