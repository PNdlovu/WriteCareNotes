## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT STEPS - YOU DECIDE

### Path A: Continue Building Now âœ…
**If you say "yes, continue"**, I will:
1. Create ChildService.ts (CRUD + business logic)
2. Create ChildProfileController.ts (REST API)
3. Create children.routes.ts (routing)
4. Create database migration
5. Create tests
6. Move to Placement module
7. Continue through all 87 modules

**Timeline**: Start immediately, complete in 17 weeks

---

### Path B: Review & Plan First ðŸ“‹
**If you say "let me review first"**, you can:
1. Review `CHILDREN_CARE_COMPLETE_MODULE_LIST.md` (comprehensive 87-module spec)
2. Review `CHILDREN_IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` (current status)
3. Review `src/domains/children/entities/Child.ts` (Child entity code)
4. Decide on phasing approach
5. Approve to proceed

---

### Path C: Customize Scope ðŸŽ¨
**If you want to adjust**, tell me:
1. Which modules are highest priority?
2. Which modules can wait?
3. Any specific compliance deadlines?
4. Any budget or resource constraints?

I'll adjust the plan accordingly.
