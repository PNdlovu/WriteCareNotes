## Issues Identified

### ⚠️ Issue 1: Duplicate MedicationAdministrationService Files

**Severity**: LOW (Non-blocking)

**Locations**:
1. `src/services/medication/MedicationAdministrationService.ts` (147 lines) - Modern, class-based
2. `src/services/medicationAdministrationService.ts` - Legacy, singleton instance

**Impact**: Potential confusion about canonical version

**Recommendation**: 
- Verify which version is actively used in production
- Remove the legacy version
- Update all imports to use the modern version

**Status**: ⏳ Documented, not blocking (code compiles successfully)

---

### ⚠️ Issue 2: Service Naming Variations

**Severity**: LOW (Documentation clarity)

Some planned services may have different names than expected:
- MedicationSchedulingService → Functionality may be part of MedicationManagementService
- MedicationComplianceService → Actually named MedicationRegulatoryComplianceService
- ControlledSubstancesService → Functionality part of MedicationRegulatoryComplianceService
- PharmacyIntegrationService → Actually named CareHomeSystemIntegrationService

**Impact**: No functional impact, just naming consistency

**Recommendation**: Document actual service mapping in architectural documentation

**Status**: ✅ Documented in this report
