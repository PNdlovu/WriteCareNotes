## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: File Renames (30 minutes)
1. Rename `HealthcareSystemIntegrationService.ts` ‚Üí `CareHomeSystemIntegrationService.ts`
2. Rename `HealthcareCacheManager.ts` ‚Üí `CareHomeCacheManager.ts`
3. Update class names inside files
4. Update test file imports

### Phase 2: Strategic Content Updates (2-3 hours)
1. Update entity documentation (2 files)
2. Update service descriptions (5 files)
3. Update type definitions (1 file)
4. Update utility documentation (1 file)

### Phase 3: Verification (30 minutes)
1. Run TypeScript compiler: `npm run build`
2. Run tests: `npm test`
3. Verify no broken imports
4. Check for compilation errors
