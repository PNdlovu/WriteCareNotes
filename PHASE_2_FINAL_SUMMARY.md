## üìù Key Decisions Made

### 1. Service #13 Skipped (Financial Management)
**Reason**: Found 10+ existing financial services in codebase
- InvoiceService, PaymentService, BudgetService
- PayrollService, ExpenseService, RevenueService
- CostCenterService, FinancialReportingService
- TaxService, AuditService

**Decision**: Skip to avoid duplication per user requirement: *"be certain before creating a new file. so no duplicates"*

**Impact**: Phase 2 reduced from 7 to 6 services (85.7% completion rate)

### 2. Health Monitoring Path
**Challenge**: Existing `/health` route for system health checks

**Decision**: Use `/health-monitoring` path for resident health services

**Rationale**: Different purposes - system health vs resident health monitoring

**Result**: No conflicts, both services coexist

---

## üéì Architecture Highlights

### Design Patterns Used
1. **Repository Pattern** - TypeORM repositories for data access
2. **Factory Pattern** - Route creation with DataSource injection
3. **DTO Pattern** - Type-safe data transfer objects
4. **Middleware Chain** - auth ‚Üí tenant isolation ‚Üí validation ‚Üí controller

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript
- **ORM**: TypeORM with PostgreSQL
- **API**: Express.js REST
- **Auth**: JWT tokens
- **Validation**: express-validator
- **Build**: TypeScript compiler
