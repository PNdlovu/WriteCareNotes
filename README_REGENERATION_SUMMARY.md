# README.md Regeneration Summary

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Repository**: WriteCareNotes (https://github.com/PNdlovu/WriteCareNotes.git)  
**Commits**: 0b974db (initial), 59babe1 (summary), [latest] (architecture correction)  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE + ARCHITECTURE CORRECTED

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT CORRECTION (October 10, 2025)

**Architecture Terminology Update**: The initial documentation incorrectly referred to WriteCareNotes as having a "microservices architecture". This has been corrected to accurately reflect the **modular monolith architecture**.

### What Changed:
- ‚ùå **Incorrect**: "53 microservices"  
- ‚úÖ **Correct**: "53 feature modules in a modular monolith"

### Why This Matters:
- **Current Architecture**: Single Express.js application with well-organized modules
- **Deployment**: Single deployment unit (not 53 separate services)
- **Database**: Shared PostgreSQL database (not per-service databases)
- **Benefits**: Simplified operations, faster development, lower infrastructure costs
- **Future**: Microservices migration planned for Phase 6 when scale requires it

---

## üéØ Objective

Regenerate the README.md file for the WriteCareNotes GitHub repository with:
- Complete, accurate, production-ready documentation
- Correct domain: https://writecarenotes.com
- Full scope of 53 microservices architecture
- All 8 British Isles jurisdictions coverage
- Comprehensive module inventory with verified LOC counts
- Audit-ready, benefit-first presentation
- Zero placeholders or stubs
