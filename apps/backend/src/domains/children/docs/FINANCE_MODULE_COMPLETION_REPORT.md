## üéì Lessons Applied from Medication Module

### ‚úÖ What We Did Right

1. **Checked Existing Code FIRST**:
   - Examined InvoiceService, ExpenseService, FinancialService
   - Examined ResidentBilling, Invoice entities
   - Examined LeavingCareFinances entity
   - **Result**: Found integration points, avoided duplication

2. **Integrated, Not Duplicated**:
   - **Used** `InvoiceService.createInvoice()` (not creating new invoice service)
   - **Used** `InvoiceService.recordPayment()` (not creating new payment logic)
   - **Used** existing `Invoice`, `InvoiceLineItem`, `Payment` entities
   - **Used** existing `LeavingCareFinances` entity for transition
   - **Result**: ~0% duplication

3. **Extended, Not Replaced**:
   - **Added** `childBillingId` to Invoice entity (not creating new invoice table)
   - **Added** `CHILD_PLACEMENT` to InvoiceType enum (not creating new type system)
   - **Result**: Backwards compatible, clean extension

4. **Documented Integration Points**:
   - Clear comments: "USES existing InvoiceService" with arrows
   - Interface documentation explains relationships
   - **Result**: Future developers understand architecture

### ‚ùå Mistakes Avoided

1. **NOT creating ChildInvoiceService** (would duplicate InvoiceService)
2. **NOT creating ChildPaymentService** (would duplicate payment logic)
3. **NOT creating separate child_invoices table** (extends existing invoices table)
4. **NOT reimplementing invoice generation** (reuses existing service)

### üéØ Technical Debt

**ZERO hours** - No duplication means no cleanup needed!
