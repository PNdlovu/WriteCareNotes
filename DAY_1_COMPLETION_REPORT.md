### 2. Care Home Terminology Update - **Strategic Success** ✅

**Approach:** Smart, context-aware updates (not blind find/replace)

#### Files Renamed (2)
1. ✅ `HealthcareSystemIntegrationService.ts` → `CareHomeSystemIntegrationService.ts`
2. ✅ `HealthcareCacheManager.ts` → `CareHomeCacheManager.ts`

#### Content Updated (9 Files)

**Entities:**
- ✅ `user.entity.ts` - "care home system" references
- ✅ `organization.entity.ts` - "care home organization"

**Services:**
- ✅ `PolicyAuthoringAssistantService.ts` - "care home policy authoring"
- ✅ `template-engine.service.ts` - "care home data processing"
- ✅ `enterprise-security.service.ts` - "care home environments"
- ✅ `AIDataMappingService.ts` - "care home data migration"
- ✅ `CareHomeSystemIntegrationService.ts` - Updated module references
- ✅ `CareHomeCacheManager.ts` - Updated class and documentation

**Utilities:**
- ✅ `express.d.ts` - "care home-specific context"
- ✅ `dateUtils.ts` - "care home date handling"

**Tests:**
- ✅ `ResidentService.test.ts` - Import statements updated

#### ✅ Strategic Preservation

**Kept "Healthcare" in these contexts (correct usage):**
- ✅ NHS healthcare systems and integration
- ✅ GP Connect and medical providers
- ✅ FHIR/HL7 medical data standards
- ✅ "NHS Continuing Healthcare" (official government term)
- ✅ Blog content about NHS healthcare integration
- ✅ Regulatory compliance text (CRA, DSPT)
- ✅ Error codes for medical context
- ✅ Migration service healthcare field mappings

**Why This Matters:**
- Professional branding: "Care home" is more appropriate than "healthcare"
- Market clarity: Clear positioning as care home software
- Technical accuracy: Maintains correct NHS/healthcare terminology
- Regulatory compliance: Preserves official terminology
