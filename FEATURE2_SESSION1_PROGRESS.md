  - ✅ JWT authentication middleware for secure connections
  - ✅ Room-based isolation (one room per policy document)
  - ✅ User presence tracking (Map<policyId, Map<userId, UserPresence>>)
  - ✅ Real-time event handlers:
    * join_policy - User enters a policy editing room
    * leave_policy - User exits a policy room
    * cursor_move - Live cursor position updates
    * text_change - Document edit events (operational transformation ready)
    * add_comment - Real-time comment posting
    * typing_start/stop - Typing indicator broadcasting
    * disconnect - Graceful connection cleanup
  - ✅ Server → Client events:
    * user_joined - Notify when user enters
    * user_left - Notify when user exits
    * cursor_update - Broadcast cursor movements
    * document_updated - Broadcast document edits
    * comment_added - Broadcast new comments
    * typing_indicator - Show typing status
    * presence_update - Send active users list
  - ✅ Automatic stale session cleanup (every 5 minutes, idle > 30 min)
  - ✅ Connection state management (active sessions, user sockets)
  - ✅ Error handling and logging
  - ✅ Graceful shutdown with cleanup
  - ✅ Helper methods: getActiveUsers(), cleanupStaleSessions(), shutdown()

#### **Dependencies Installed** ✅
- ✅ socket.io@^4.x - WebSocket library
- ✅ @types/socket.io@^3.x - TypeScript types
- ✅ Installed with --legacy-peer-deps flag (NestJS version conflicts)

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Database Layer
```
collaboration_sessions (18 columns, 5 indexes)
├── id (UUID PK)
├── policy_id (FK → policy_drafts)
├── user_id (FK → users)
├── session_token (unique)
├── cursor_position (JSONB)
├── selection_range (JSONB)
├── is_editing (boolean)
├── status (enum: active/idle/ended/disconnected)
├── socket_id (WebSocket connection)
└── metadata (JSONB)

policy_comments (19 columns, 6 indexes)
├── id (UUID PK)
├── policy_id (FK → policy_drafts)
├── user_id (FK → users)
├── parent_comment_id (FK → self, nullable)
├── content (TEXT, Markdown)
├── position_selector (JSONB)
├── status (enum: active/resolved/deleted/hidden)
├── comment_type (enum: 6 types)
├── mentioned_users (UUID[])
├── resolved_by (FK → users, nullable)
├── edited_by (FK → users, nullable)
├── liked_by (UUID[])
└── metadata (JSONB)
```

### WebSocket Layer
```
PolicyCollaborationGateway
├── Socket.io Server (WSS://)
├── Authentication Middleware (JWT)
├── Room Management (policy:${policyId})
├── Event Handlers (13 events)
├── Presence Tracking (Map-based)
├── Session Cleanup (5-minute interval)
└── Graceful Shutdown
```

### Event Flow
```
Client connects → Authenticate → Join policy room → 
→ Send presence update → Broadcast to room → 
→ Handle events (cursor, edits, comments) → 
→ Broadcast to all room participants → 
→ Disconnect → Clean up sessions
```
