# UI Pages and Screens

## Frontend Component Analysis

Based on code analysis of React components in `src/components/`, the following UI screens have been identified:

| Component | Data Source | Backend Dependencies | Classification | Evidence |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|----------------|----------|
| MedicationDashboard.tsx | Real API | medication-management.ts, medication-inventory.ts | IMPLEMENTATION | Production component with real API integration |
| ClinicalSafetyDashboard.tsx | Real API | medication-compliance.ts, medication-interaction.ts | IMPLEMENTATION | Clinical safety monitoring with real data |
| ControlledSubstancesRegister.tsx | Real API | controlled-substances.ts | IMPLEMENTATION | Controlled drug management with audit trails |
| HealthcareIntegration.tsx | Real API | healthcare-integration.ts | IMPLEMENTATION | NHS integration with real endpoints |
| ConsentManagementDashboard.tsx | Real API | consent.ts | IMPLEMENTATION | GDPR compliance with tenant middleware |
| ComprehensiveAnalyticsDashboard.tsx | Real API | financial/financialAnalyticsRoutes.ts | IMPLEMENTATION | Financial analytics with comprehensive middleware |
| FamilyEngagementPortal.tsx | Real API | family-engagement.ts | IMPLEMENTATION | Family communication portal |
| DocumentManagementDashboard.tsx | Real API | document-management.ts | IMPLEMENTATION | Document management system |

## Key Findings

- **No Mock Data Detected**: All components appear to use real API endpoints
- **No Placeholder Components**: All identified components have full implementations
- **Strong Backend Integration**: Each component has corresponding backend routes with proper middleware
- **Production Ready**: Components include proper error handling and data validation

## Mobile Screens

No mobile-specific screens found in `src/components/` - this appears to be a web-based application.

## Mock/Placeholder Analysis

No evidence of mock data, fixtures, or placeholder components found in the codebase. All UI components are classified as IMPLEMENTATION with real API integration.
