- Login from Nigeria when user is UK-based (account compromise?)
- Accessing ex-partner's resident record (insider threat?)
- Database query with 'DROP TABLE' (SQL injection attempt?)
```

**Response Workflow**:
```
Anomaly detected
  ↓
Risk score calculated (0-100)
  ↓
If score >70: Auto-suspend account + notify security team
If score 40-70: Alert manager for investigation
If score <40: Log for review
  ↓
Investigation workflow opens

{
  resident: "Mr. Jones",
  fallRisk: "high",
  probability: 0.68,
  contributingFactors: [
    "3 falls in last 30 days",
    "Recent mobility score decline (8 → 5)",
    "Taking sedative medication"
  ],

#### **19. Supervision Quality Scoring** (Supervision)
**Priority**: 🔥 LOW (Metrics)  
**Impact**: Continuous improvement  
**Effort**: Low (2-3 weeks)  

**Current State**: Supervision occurs but quality not measured  
**Enhancement**: Score supervision effectiveness

**Quality Metrics**:
```typescript
interface SupervisionQualityScore {
  supervisionSessionId: string;
  overallScore: number; // 0-100
  metrics: {
    frequency: number; // Adherence to schedule
    duration: number; // Actual vs planned time
    goalCompletion: number; // % of goals achieved
    staffSatisfaction: number; // Post-session survey
    actionItemFollow-up: number; // % completed on time
    documentation: number; // Completeness of notes
  };
  trend: 'improving' | 'stable' | 'declining';
  recommendations: string[];
}

// Example
{
  overallScore: 78,
  metrics: {
    frequency: 95, // 19/20 sessions on time
    duration: 85, // Average 45 min (target 60 min)
    goalCompletion: 70, // 7/10 goals achieved
    staffSatisfaction: 90, // Staff rated 4.5/5
    actionItemFollowup: 60, // 6/10 actions completed
    documentation: 100 // All sessions documented
  },
  trend: 'improving',
  recommendations: [
    'Increase session duration to full 60 minutes',
    'Improve action item follow-up tracking',
    'Continue current frequency (excellent)'
  ]
}
```

---

#### **20. Escalation Routing Engine** (CommsHub)
**Priority**: 🔥 MEDIUM  
**Impact**: Urgent message handling  
**Effort**: Medium (4-5 weeks)  

**Current State**: Manual escalation  
**Enhancement**: Intelligent routing based on urgency, content, time

**Routing Logic**:
```typescript
interface EscalationRule {
  ruleId: string;
  name: string;
  trigger: {
    keywords?: string[]; // "emergency", "urgent", "safeguarding"
    category?: MessageCategory;
    priority?: MessagePriority;
    sentiment?: 'very_negative';
    timeOfDay?: { start: string; end: string };
  };
  actions: {
    notifyRoles: string[]; // ["manager", "senior_carer", "on_call"]
    channelOverride?: CommunicationChannelType; // Force SMS for emergencies
    escalationDelay?: number; // Escalate if no response in X minutes
    autoResponse?: string;
  };
}

// Example: Emergency escalation rule
{
  ruleId: 'ESC-001',
  name: 'Emergency Keyword Detection',
  trigger: {
    keywords: ['emergency', 'urgent', 'help', 'immediate'],
    priority: 'EMERGENCY'
  },
  actions: {
    notifyRoles: ['on_call', 'manager', 'senior_carer'],
    channelOverride: 'SMS', // Bypass user preference, use SMS
    escalationDelay: 5, // If no response in 5 min, escalate to next level
    autoResponse: 'Your urgent message has been received. A manager will respond within 5 minutes.'
  }
}

// Escalation chain
Level 1: Assigned carer (2 min response SLA)
  ↓ (no response)
Level 2: Senior carer (5 min response SLA)
  ↓ (no response)
Level 3: Care home manager (10 min response SLA)
  ↓ (no response)
Level 4: On-call director (immediate escalation)
```

  // Feature flags (enable/disable features per tenant)
  features: {
    policyMicroservices: boolean;
    iotIntegration: boolean;
    advancedAnalytics: boolean;
    communicationAdapters: boolean;
  };
  
  // Customization
  branding: {
    logo: string;
    primaryColor: string;
    secondaryColor: string;
    customDomain?: string;
  };
  
  // Data isolation
  databaseSchema: string; // Separate schema per tenant
  storageContainer: string; // Separate blob storage
  
  // Compliance
  dataResidency: 'UK' | 'EU' | 'US'; // Where data is stored
  retentionPolicy: {
    careNotes: number; // Days
    auditLogs: number;
    communications: number;
  };
  
  // Billing
  subscriptionTier: 'starter' | 'professional' | 'enterprise';
  billingCycle: 'monthly' | 'annual';
  userLicenses: number;
}

// Tenant isolation strategies
1. Schema per tenant (PostgreSQL schemas)
2. Row-level security (tenant_id column)
3. Separate storage containers (Azure Blob)
4. API gateway with tenant routing
5. Separate Redis caches
```

  jurisdiction: 'England' | 'Scotland' | 'Wales' | 'NorthernIreland' | 'Ireland';
  
  regulatoryBodies: {
    primary: string; // CQC, Care Inspectorate, CIW, RQIA, HIQA
    secondary: string[];
  };
  
  legislation: {
    primaryAct: string;
    gdprVariant: 'UK-GDPR' | 'EU-GDPR';
    healthAct: string;
    socialCareAct: string;
  };
  
  terminologyMappings: {
    // England → Scotland mappings
    'care home': 'care home' | 'care service';
    'CQC': 'Care Inspectorate';
    'safeguarding': 'adult protection';
    'service user': 'resident' | 'tenant';
  };
  
  policyTemplates: {
    medicationManagement: string;
    safeguarding: string;
    infectionControl: string;
  };
}

// Example: Scottish vs English policy
{
  jurisdiction: 'Scotland',
  regulatoryBodies: {
    primary: 'Care Inspectorate',
    secondary: ['Scottish Government', 'Healthcare Improvement Scotland']
  },
  legislation: {
    primaryAct: 'Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010',
    gdprVariant: 'UK-GDPR',
    healthAct: 'Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003',
    socialCareAct: 'Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Act 2013'
  },
  terminologyMappings: {
    'CQC': 'Care Inspectorate',

    'No major organizational changes'
  ],
  scenarios: {
    pessimistic: [/* Turnover increases to 25% */],
    realistic: [/* Current trends continue */],
    optimistic: [/* Successful retention program */]
  },
  recommendations: [

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

### **DO**
✅ Focus on care quality outcomes (resident safety, CQC ratings)  
✅ Prioritize user choice and empowerment (residents, families, staff)  
✅ Build defensible competitive moats (Jurisdictional Sync, Communication Adapters)  
✅ Invest in infrastructure (offline, IoT, multi-tenant)  
✅ Maintain ethical AI leadership (explainability, bias prevention)  

### **DON'T**
❌ Add features without clear care quality link  
❌ Overcomplicate UI (care staff need simplicity)  
❌ Build before validating with pilot care homes  
❌ Compromise on security/compliance for speed  
❌ Ignore user feedback from existing customers  

### **VALIDATE FIRST**
🔍 Pilot new features with 2-3 care homes before rollout  
🔍 Conduct CQC alignment checks for regulatory features  
🔍 User testing with actual care staff (not just managers)  
🔍 Cost-benefit analysis for expensive features (IoT, multi-tenant)  
🔍 Privacy impact assessments for behavioral analytics
