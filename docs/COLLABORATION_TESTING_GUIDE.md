## Troubleshooting

### Issue: WebSocket not connecting
**Check:**
- Server running on correct port (5000)
- CORS enabled in server config
- Browser console for connection errors

### Issue: Events not received
**Check:**
- User successfully joined room (`join_policy` called)
- WebSocket connection active (`socket.connected === true`)
- Event names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Issue: Notifications not appearing
**Check:**
- `useCollaboration` hook imported correctly
- `CollaborationNotifications` component rendered
- Notification queue not empty (check state)

### Issue: Cursor positions inaccurate
**Check:**
- Cursor data includes correct `line` and `column`
- CSS selectors valid and unique
- Throttling applied to cursor updates (max 10/second)

## Automated Testing (TODO)

Future improvements:
- Unit tests for services (Jest)
- Integration tests for WebSocket events (socket.io-client)
- E2E tests for multi-user scenarios (Playwright/Cypress)
- Load testing (Artillery, k6)
