# Consent Module â€“ WriteCareNotes

## Purpose & Value Proposition

The Consent Module manages resident and family consent records, ensuring compliance with GDPR and healthcare regulations. This module provides comprehensive consent tracking, withdrawal capabilities, and audit trails for all consent-related activities.

## Endpoints & API Surface

### Core Endpoints
- `GET /api/consent/dashboard` - Get consent dashboard
- `POST /api/consent` - Create new consent record
- `GET /api/consent/:id` - Get specific consent details
- `PUT /api/consent/:id` - Update consent record
- `DELETE /api/consent/:id` - Withdraw consent

### Consent Management
- `POST /api/consent/:id/withdraw` - Withdraw specific consent
- `GET /api/consent/resident/:residentId` - Get resident's consents
- `POST /api/consent/bulk` - Create multiple consents
- `GET /api/consent/expiring` - Get expiring consents

### Compliance Endpoints
- `GET /api/consent/audit` - Get consent audit trail
- `GET /api/consent/compliance` - Get compliance status
- `POST /api/consent/verify` - Verify consent validity

## Audit Trail Logic

### Audit Events
- **Consent Given**: When resident or family gives consent
- **Consent Withdrawn**: When consent is withdrawn
- **Consent Updated**: When consent details are modified
- **Consent Expired**: When consent reaches expiration
- **Consent Verified**: When consent is verified by staff

### Audit Data Structure
```json
{
  "event": "consent_given",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-19T10:30:00Z",
  "correlationId": "uuid-here",
  "userId": "staff-123",
  "residentId": "resident-456",
  "consentId": "consent-789",
  "details": {
    "consentType": "medical_treatment",
    "givenBy": "resident",
    "witnessedBy": "Nurse Smith",
    "expiryDate": "2025-12-19T10:30:00Z",
    "dataCategories": ["medical_records", "medication_history"]
  }
}
```
