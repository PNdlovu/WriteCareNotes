## Audit Trail Logic

### Event Logging
- All system events are logged with comprehensive context and metadata
- User activities are tracked with user identification and timestamps
- System changes are documented with before/after values
- Security events are logged with severity levels and response actions

### Data Integrity
- Audit logs are cryptographically signed to prevent tampering
- Log integrity is continuously verified and monitored
- Audit data is stored in tamper-proof storage systems
- Chain of custody is maintained for all audit evidence

### Compliance Tracking
- Regulatory compliance activities are tracked and documented
- Policy violations are logged with remediation actions
- Compliance training completion is audited
- Regulatory reporting activities are documented
