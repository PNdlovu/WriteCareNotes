## Security Architecture

WriteCareNotes implements a comprehensive security framework designed for healthcare environments:

### Zero Trust Security Model
- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: All access requests are authenticated and authorized
- **Least Privilege Access**: Users receive minimum necessary permissions
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security posture assessment
- **Micro-segmentation**: Network and data isolation

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all administrative access
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permission management
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure, stateless authentication
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with timeout

### Data Protection
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Field-level encryption for sensitive data
- **TLS 1.3**: All data in transit encryption
- **Key Management**: Secure key rotation and storage
- **Data Classification**: Automatic PII detection and protection

### Compliance & Standards
- **GDPR Compliance**: Full data protection implementation
- **NHS Digital Standards**: DCB0129, DCB0160, DSPT certified
- **CQC Compliance**: Care Quality Commission standards
- **Cyber Essentials Plus**: UK government security standard
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
