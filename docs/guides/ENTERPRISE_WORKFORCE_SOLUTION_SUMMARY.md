# Enterprise Workforce Management Solution - Complete Implementation

## üéØ Project Overview

I have successfully built a comprehensive enterprise workforce management solution that includes both React Native mobile app and PWA capabilities. This solution supports workers with self-serve portals for payroll, clock in/out, documents, rota, payslips, overtime booking, holidays, and provides role-based access for managers, deputies, executives, and operations teams.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decision: Single App with Role-Based Access Control

**‚úÖ RECOMMENDED APPROACH IMPLEMENTED**
