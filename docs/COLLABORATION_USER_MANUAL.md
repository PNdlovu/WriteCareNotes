## Best Practices

### For Effective Collaboration

1. **Use @mentions wisely**
   - Only mention users who need to see the comment
   - Avoid mentioning everyone for general comments

2. **Choose appropriate comment types**
   - Use "Suggestion" for proposed changes
   - Use "Question" when you need clarification
   - Use "Approval" to confirm agreement

3. **Resolve comments promptly**
   - Mark comments as resolved when issues are addressed
   - Keeps the comment list clean and focused

4. **Pin important information**
   - Pin critical action items or decisions
   - Unpin once they're no longer relevant

5. **Leave sessions when done**
   - Click "Leave Collaboration" instead of just closing the tab
   - Helps others see who's actively working

### For Performance

1. **Keep sessions under 30 minutes**
   - Long sessions can become cluttered
   - Start a new session for fresh discussions

2. **Limit to 5-10 active users**
   - More users = more cursor overlays
   - Consider separate sessions for large teams

3. **Use comments instead of constant edits**
   - Prevents edit conflicts
   - Provides clear discussion history

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I see edit history?**  
A: Not yet. This feature is planned for a future update.

**Q: Can I delete someone else's comment?**  
A: No, only admins can delete comments. You can reply or resolve them.

**Q: What happens if I lose my internet connection?**  
A: The system will try to reconnect automatically (5 attempts). You'll see a "Reconnecting..." notification. When reconnected, you'll catch up on missed events.

**Q: Can I collaborate on multiple policies at once?**  
A: Yes, but you'll need separate browser tabs for each policy. Each tab maintains its own WebSocket connection.

A: Successful comments appear in the comment list immediately. If there's an error, you'll see a red error notification.

**Q: Can I edit a comment after posting?**  
A: Yes, click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) on your own comments. Others will see "(edited)" indicator.

**Q: What's the maximum number of users in a session?**  
A: Technically unlimited, but we recommend 10 or fewer for best performance.

**Q: Can I use rich text formatting in comments?**  
A: Currently, comments support plain text and @mentions. Rich formatting (bold, italic, links) is planned for future updates.
